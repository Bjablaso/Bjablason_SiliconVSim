# Project Overview 
This project aims to integrate tools like JUnit,  Jacoco, CheckStyle, and SpotBugs for ensuring robust code quality and test coverage. 
The workflow will include writing clean, efficient code with a focus on specific design patterns to enhance maintainability and scalability.

## Project Flow and Source Code Explanation
    ** Steps to Complete the Project: **
      &#9675;  Configure Gradle for dependency management and build automation.
      &#9675; I integrate JUnit for testing, Jacoco for test coverage, CheckStyle for code styl enforcement, and SpotBugs for static analysis.
    
        ** Design Patterns **
            &#9675; Singleton Pattern 
            &#9675; Use for managing shared resources like configuration settings or logging.
        
       ** Factory Pattern  **
           &#9675; mplement for creating instances of complex objects, especially where multiple configurations are required.
       
       ** Observer Pattern **
            &#9675; Employ for handling event-driven communication between components, such as notifying listeners of state changes.
